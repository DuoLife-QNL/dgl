GraphSAGE: Aggregate with SAGEConv
MB: Mini-batch training. A batch of nodes are used as training nodes during one iteration. 
FB: Full-batch training. All nodes are used as training nodes in one iteration. An iteration is an epoch. 
NS: Neighbor Sampling. Using sampled neighbors' aggregation to estimate the aggregation result of the complete neighborhood.
FG: Full Graph. Aggregate the complete neighborhood.
